# HelpChat-JAM
Repo for the upcoming plugin jam.

The plugin is gonna be a simple parkour plugin, each player can have their own parkour running on set cordinates.
The parkour is infinite, next checkpoint will be generated around the player when they finish the current one.

# Commands
/parkour help - shows all the commands

/parkour start - start the parkour

/parkour end - end the parkour

Once player ends the parkour, every checkpoint will be deleted and the player will be teleported where they started the parkour from.
